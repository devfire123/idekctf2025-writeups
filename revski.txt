CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

This challenge involves SKI combinator calculus, a mathematical system for expressing 
computation using only three basic combinators:
- S: Substitution combinator
- K: Constant combinator  
- I: Identity combinator

The challenge provides two interpreters (C++ and Python) that evaluate SKI expressions,
but they are designed to be computationally expensive and resource-intensive.

================================================================================
FILES PROVIDED
================================================================================

1. interpreter.cpp - C++ implementation of SKI interpreter
2. interpreter.py - Python implementation of SKI interpreter  
3. program.txt - A massive SKI expression (111,791 characters)

================================================================================
INITIAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The challenge provides two interpreters that:
1. Read an SKI expression from program.txt
2. Take a flag as input
3. Convert the flag to bits and map them to variables (_F0, _F1, _F2, etc.)
4. Substitute these variables into the SKI expression
5. Reduce the expression to normal form
6. Check if the result is K (correct) or (K I) (incorrect)

The key insight is that the interpreters are intentionally resource-intensive and 
cannot be used directly for brute force attacks.

================================================================================
SOLUTION APPROACH
================================================================================

Instead of trying to evaluate the massive SKI expression, I analyzed the structure 
of program.txt to understand how the flag is encoded.

Key observations:
1. The program.txt contains variables _F0 through _F559 (560 total variables)
2. This suggests the flag is 560 bits = 70 bytes long
3. Some variables appear wrapped in a specific pattern: 
   (((S ((S I) (K (K I)))) (K K)) _Fi)
4. Other variables appear unwrapped: _Fi

This binary pattern (wrapped = 1, unwrapped = 0) likely encodes the flag itself.

================================================================================
DETAILED SOLUTION
================================================================================

Step 1: Extract the binary pattern
- Used regex to find all wrapped variables: 
  \(\(\(S \(\(S I\) \(K \(K I\)\)\)\) \(K K\)\) (_F[0-9]+)\)
- Created a binary pattern where 1 = wrapped, 0 = unwrapped
- Found 267 wrapped variables and 293 unwrapped variables

Step 2: Convert binary pattern to bytes
- Grouped bits into bytes (8 bits each)
- Converted each byte to ASCII character

Step 3: Try different interpretations
- Direct ASCII: Invalid characters
- Reversed bits: Invalid characters  
- Inverted bits: SUCCESS!

The inverted binary pattern (0 = wrapped, 1 = unwrapped) produced the flag.

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Binary Pattern Analysis:
- Total variables: 560 (_F0 to _F559)
- Wrapped variables: 267
- Unwrapped variables: 293
- Pattern: [1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,...]

Flag Extraction:
- Inverted pattern: [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,...]
- Converted to bytes: 69 64 65 6B 7B 64 31 64 5F 79 30 75 5F 30 70 74 31 6D 31 7A 33 5F 34 6E 64 5F 73 31 64 33 63 68 34 6E 6E 33 6C 33 64 5F 30 72 5F 73 30 6C 76 33 64 5F 31 6E 5F 37 68 33 5F 31 6E 74 33 6E 64 33 64 5F 77 34 79 7D
- ASCII: idek{d1d_y0u_0pt1m1z3_4nd_s1d3ch4nn3l3d_0r_s0lv3d_1n_7h3_1nt3nd3d_w4y}

================================================================================
FLAG VERIFICATION
================================================================================

The flag "idek{d1d_y0u_0pt1m1z3_4nd_s1d3ch4nn3l3d_0r_s0lv3d_1n_7h3_1nt3nd3d_w4y}" 
translates to: "did you optimize and sidechanneled or solved in the intended way"

This is a meta-commentary on the challenge itself - the intended solution was to 
analyze the pattern rather than brute force the SKI expression evaluation.

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. Always analyze the structure of provided files before attempting computation
2. Look for patterns in how data is encoded
3. Consider that the challenge might be about finding the intended approach
4. Resource-intensive operations are often hints that brute force is not the way
5. Binary patterns can encode meaningful data in unexpected ways

================================================================================
TOOLS USED
================================================================================

- Python 3 for pattern analysis
- Regular expressions for variable extraction
- Binary manipulation for flag reconstruction
- Text analysis for pattern recognition

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This challenge demonstrates the importance of understanding the problem before 
attempting to solve it. The massive SKI expression was a red herring - the real 
solution was in the pattern of how variables were encoded in the expression.

The flag itself confirms this: the intended way was to analyze and extract the 
pattern, not to optimize and side-channel the computation.
